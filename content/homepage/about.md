## Self Introduction

I am a 4th year doctoral student in the [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/) group. My research topics and interests include:

* General probabilistic and deep generative models
* Gaussian processes with both categorical and continuous input variables
* Reliable and efficient usage of numerical solvers in probabilistic models
* Dynamic modeling of single cell RNA-seq data
* Molecular network inference
